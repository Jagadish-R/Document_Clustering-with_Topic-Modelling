# Document_Clustering-with_Topic-Modelling
NLP (Natural Language Processing)

ABSTRACT:
    Thousands and even millions of news  are generated by various news sites everyday. In many cases labelling the news articles according to labels by reading long unstructured  news for supervised learning will consume large amounts of time and effort. Hence clustering news using unsupervised learning becomes very useful for these news organisations.

Our project helps many news organisations in the world to cluster similar news articles together

It helps to save time by reading long news articles and then grouping articles into categories.
